        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm currently based in Barcelona. Here's a shortened work-study timeline of my life. There is some overlap between events, so years indicate when I 
            approximately stopped doing the thing. </p>

                    <h4>MSc in Computer Science | BarcelonaTech </h4>
                    <p> Started while at CaixaBank. On my free time, learning about extracting 
                        latent knowledge from models. I think it's pretty cool!

                    <h4>Data Scientist | CaixaBank</h4>
                    <p>For ~2 years, I mainly did asset impairment modeling, reengineering of processes and data analysis. 
                    The main project I developed was implemented in the bank's production 
                    environment. SAS was very interesting. </p>

                    <h4>Research Assistant | U. of Waikato & BarcelonaTech</h4>
                    <p>For ~2 years, I was interned and employed in various ways by the two institutions. Participated in two
                        distinct projects. 
                        <li>TAIAO: The "Time-evolving Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Advanced 
                            Open Environmental science" project. I worked on explainable AI under the supervision
                            of Dr. Alvin Jia and Prof. Albert Bifet. In particular, on the evaluation of explanations 
                            and if explanations could be extracted from Attention. </li>
                        <li>COPEDI-Cat: A COVID-19 emergency response group by the Catalan government. Many paediatricians 
                            collaborated in a network. As part of the BIOCOMSC research group, I was tasked with data 
                            analysis and modeling. To this day, we still collaborate in one-offs. </li>

                    <h4>BSc in Data Science and Engineering | BarcelonaTech</h4>
                    <p> I was a test subject (first promotion) of the debut data science BSc in Spain. ML, information theory, systems... Very fun! 
                        While majors and minors do not exist in Spain's higher education system, my thesis and internships were primarily ML focused. </p>
