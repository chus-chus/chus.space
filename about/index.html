                    <p>For ~2 years, I was interned and employed in various ways by the two institutions. Participated in two
                        distinct projects. 
                        <li>TAIAO: The "Time-evolving Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Advanced 
                            Open Environmental science" project. I worked on explainable AI under the supervision
                            of Dr. Alvin Jia and Prof. Albert Bifet. In particular, on the evaluation of explanations 
                            and if explanations could be extracted from Attention. </li>
                        <li>COPEDI-Cat: A COVID-19 emergency response group by the Catalan government. Many paediatricians 
                            collaborated in a network. As part of the BIOCOMSC research group, I was tasked with data 
                            analysis and modeling. To this day, we still collaborate in one-offs. </li>

                        While majors and minors do not exist in Spain's higher education system, my thesis and internships were primarily ML focused. </p>
